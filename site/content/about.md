Title: About

## Why

ncf was presented by [Jonathan Clarke](http://twitter.com/jooooooon42/), one of the project's founders, at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/ncf_abstracting_cfengines_complexity_provide_structured_powerful_framework/) in 2014.

Here are the slides from his talk, that are the best overview of "why" we have for now :)

## Acknowledgments

ncf was created by a bunch of CFEngine consultants from [Normation](http://www.normation.com) and [Savoir Faire Linux](http://www.savoirfairelinux.com).

Many of our customers inspired us and dreamed up parts of this framework. They can not be named here, but a big thank you to them.

## Development

ncf is developed on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Normation/ncf). There is also a [bugtracker](http://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/projects/ncf/issues/).

Contributions are very welcome! Please submit a Pull Request on GitHub (see [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for some more information on how to do this).
